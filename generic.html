								<header><h2> About Me</h2></header>
								<p>I’m Benedictus Harley Kartawidjaja, an international student from Indonesia who moved to Vancouver in 2021. As an incoming fourth-year Statistics student at the University of British Columbia, I have developed a solid understanding of statistics, environmental science, and business analytics. My academic experiences have sparked a strong interest in data analytics and environmental solutions, especially in tackling the urgent challenge of climate change.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am actively seeking a co-op opportunity for September 2024. I am open to relocating within Canada for the right opportunity that aligns with my career aspirations. Ideally, I am looking for roles in fields related to data analytics, business intelligence, IT support, or financial analysis, building on the experiences I have gained in these areas. I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to impactful projects while continuing to grow professionally.</p>
								<header><h2>Job Experience</h2></header>
								<p>Starting at UBC Sauder School of Business in September 2021 as an Information Technology Support Assistant, I’ve been actively involved in enhancing commerce courses and resolving technical issues. Each shift allows me to tackle various challenges, which I document and report using ServiceNow. This role has greatly refined my IT support and troubleshooting skills.</p>

									<p>During the summer of 2023, I pursued my interest in business and analytics through internships in Jakarta. At PT Kalbe Farma, Tbk, I worked as a Data Analyst, focusing on data manipulation and business intelligence. I used SQL and Tableau to create around 20 interactive financial dashboards, ensuring data integrity and conducting thorough exploratory data analysis with Excel. This experience significantly enhanced my data analysis and reporting capabilities. </p>
									
									<p>Earlier in 2023, as a Finance Analyst at Binaartha Sekuritas, I deepened my passion for finance. Over four months, I conducted price forecasts using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and provided strategic stock recommendations.</p>
									
									<p> Currently, I’m working as a Research Project Assistant at UBC School of Nursing with Dr. Rubee Dev since May 2024. I contribute to developing a project analyzing risk factors for hypertension and diabetes in Nepalese women using multivariate logistic regression, and I lead a project for Vancouver Coastal Health analyzing COPD and diabetes case definitions using data from the CPCSSN database. This experience is enhancing my project management, statistical modeling, and data analysis skills.</p>
									
									<p>Through these diverse experiences, I’ve built a strong skill set in project management, statistical modeling, IT support, data analysis, and financial analysis. I am eager to apply these skills and pursue continuous learning to contribute and gain further experience.</p>
